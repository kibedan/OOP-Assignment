Case Scenario: XYZ Software Solutions is developing an employee management system using C++. The system should manage employee records, including their names, IDs, and salaries. The company wants to implement Object-Oriented Programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to make the system more efficient and maintainable.

As a software developer, you are required to design and implement the core functionalities of the employee management system using OOP principles in C++.

Assignment Tasks:

    Introduction (5 Marks)

        Define Object-Oriented Programming and its significance.

        Explain the key OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction) with examples.

    Analysis of the Case Scenario (5 Marks)

        Identify the key functional requirements of the employee management system.

        Discuss how OOP principles can be applied to design the system effectively.

    Implementation Using C++ (5 Marks)

        Write a C++ program that implements the employee management system using classes and objects.

        Implement the following classes and their inheritance structure:

            Base Class: Employee

                Attributes: Name, Employee ID, Salary

                Methods: Input employee details, Display employee details

            Derived Class: Manager (inherits from Employee)

                Additional Attributes: Department, Bonus

                Additional Methods: Display manager details including department and bonus

            Derived Class: Engineer (inherits from Employee)

                Additional Attributes: Specialization, Project Assigned

                Additional Methods: Display engineer details including specialization and project

            Class: EmployeeManagementSystem (Manages employee records)

                Methods: Add Employee, Display all Employees, Search Employee by ID

        Ensure the use of encapsulation (private attributes with getter and setter methods), inheritance (shared attributes from Employee class), and polymorphism (overriding the Display method in derived classes).

    Conclusion and Future Recommendations (5 Marks)

        Summarize the importance of OOP in software development.

        Provide recommendations on how the employee management system can be further improved using advanced OOP concepts.
